# YATERM
YATERM is a homebrew terminal application written in 8080 assembly from scratch, targeting the Altair 8800 (Altairduino). This was mostly as an exercise of "do I understand the 8080 enough to do something useful"

## YATERM V2.0
This version of YATERM is completely rewritten from scratch, using my 2 years of experience since starting the first version.

#### Important!
File sending works...mostly!
The first character doesn't show on the screen (yet).


##### Bugs
- Upon exit and restart, the altair terminal screen no longer seems to respond to the connected computer
- Menu behavior may not be ideal quite yet (pauses/no pauses where there shouldn't be)
