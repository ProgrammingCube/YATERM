# YATERM
### What is YATERM?
YATERM is a terminal written in 8080 assembly from scracth, targeting the Altair 8800 (Altairduino).


This is the FROZEN branch, no improvments on this particular code will be made by me. I'm working on the master branch, and I will eventually move to the MAC assembler so I can do multi-source.
